RDFa tab
========

OXID eShop provides well-prepared information for search engines, portals and other systems. It can be displayed as so-called rich snippets - detailed information on a search result. The data is prepared based on the Resource Description Framework (RDFa) and the GoodRelations description language optimised for e-commerce.

The :guilabel:`RDFa` tab establishes a logical link between the payment method and the payment values predefined in GoodRelations.
