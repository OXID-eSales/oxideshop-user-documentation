Category tab
============

On the :guilabel:`Categories` tab, you can assign one or more categories to an attribute.

If several attributes are assigned to a category, you can also change their sorting and thus the order in which they are displayed.

Functions
----------

By assigning categories,

* allow filtering by attributes.

  A drop-down list with all values of the attribute is displayed in the category overview of the store. When a value from this list is selected, the filter is applied and the items displayed in the category are updated.

  For more information, see :ref:`setup/attributes/attributes:Enabling filtering with attribute values`.

* allow similar products to be displayed.

  For more information, see :ref:`setup/attributes/attributes:Displaying similar products`.

Procedure
---------

The :guilabel:`Assign Categories` button opens a new window in which you can assign categories to the attribute.

   Attributes - Categories tab

All categories are displayed in the left-hand list in the assignment window.

Move the desired categories to the middle list using drag \& drop. This shows all categories that use this attribute.

Hold down the Ctrl key for multiple selection. In the right-hand list, change the sorting of the attributes of a category if there are several attributes for a category.

To do this, use the small buttons with the arrow symbols to move a selected attribute to the desired position.

Use sorting to influence the order in which the filters based on the attributes and their values are arranged in the category overview. The order of the attributes defined in the assignment window overwrites the sorting that you have defined for the attributes.
