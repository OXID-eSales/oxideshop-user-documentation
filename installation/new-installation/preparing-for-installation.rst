==========================

Some preparations are necessary for the new installation of OXID eShop.

|schritt| Installing Composer 2.2.23
------------------------------------

OXID eShop 6 is no longer installed based on packaged and downloadable installation packages but with the help of Composer. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP, a tool that takes into account the dependencies of a project’s program components while installing the files of that project in a defined directory.

Composer is required for the new installation of OXID eShop. Installation instructions can be found in the “Getting Started” section of the Composer website: http://getcomposer.org.

|schritt| Providing shop files
------------------------------

The shop files are provided by Composer. Depending on the shop edition, different commands have to be run in the shell. The shop files are stored in a subdirectory that is specified with :command:`your_project_name` in the command. This is based on the directory in which the command is run in the shell. Specify the :command:`--no-dev` parameter if the development-related files are not required.

.. hint:: For the installation of Professional and Enterprise Edition, you will also need the login data that you received in the e-mail for the current release.

Community Edition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:command:`composer create-project --no-dev oxid-esales/oxideshop-project your_project_name dev-b-6.5-ce`

Professional Edition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:command:`composer create-project --no-dev oxid-esales/oxideshop-project your_project_name dev-b-6.5-pe`

Enterprise Edition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:command:`composer create-project --no-dev oxid-esales/oxideshop-project your_project_name dev-b-6.5-ee`

Once Composer has finished, the new directory named with *your_project_name* will be available. This is the main (root) directory of the project that contains all the files needed to install OXID eShop.

|schritt| Configuring Apache
----------------------------

The next step is moving the main directory to a directory that the HTTP server can access. The Apache document root directory must point to the :file:`/source` directory of the main directory.

|schritt| Customising file and directory permissions
----------------------------------------------------

The HTTP server requires read and write access to the following directories and their subdirectories at runtime:

:file:`/source/export` |br|
:file:`/source/log/` |br|
:file:`/source/out/pictures/` |br|
:file:`/source/out/media/` |br|
:file:`/source/tmp/` |br|
:file:`/var/`

The CLI user (Command Line Interface) additionally requires read and write access for the directory :file:`/var/`.

For the web-based setup, the HTTP server must have write access to the following directory and files:

:file:`/source/Setup` |br|
:file:`/source/config.inc.php` |br|
:file:`/source/.htaccess`

|schritt| Creating a database
-----------------------------

OXID eShop requires a MySQL database to store all products, categories, customer and order data, and other information. Most web hosts offer database access through a special website, such as phpMyAdmin. If you need further assistance, contact your OXID Hosting Partner or Internet Service Provider (ISP).

You have the following options:

* Recommended: Create a new MySQL database. You can select any name for the database, for example, *oxid_eshop*.

 Make sure to remember the name of the database and the assigned login data for the database (username and password).

 You will need this data when running the setup.

* Alternatively: Create the database during the setup.
