   **Data loss**

   To avoid possible data loss, do the following:

   * Always run the update in a test environment, a copy of your current store, first.

   * Always proceed as follows when updating:

     1. Create a backup of the store files and database before the update.
     #. After the update, test the store again. |br|
        In particular, check whether the ordering process and the payment and shipping methods work.
