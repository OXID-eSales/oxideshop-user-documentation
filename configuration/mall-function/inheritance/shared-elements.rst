Shared elements
===============

Shared elements are payment methods, countries, users, user groups, and reviews. These are used in all shops, but can only be maintained in the main shop.

Users are only shared with all shops if the :guilabel:`Allow users from other shops` option is activated in the main shop. If this setting is not selected in the :guilabel:`Mall` tab under :menuselection:`Master Settings --> Core Settings`, each shop will manage its own users.
