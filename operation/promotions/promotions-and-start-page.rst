------------
A large part of the start page is taken by products that are presented as new additions to the shop.

The display of products in the category is determined by a setting in the :guilabel:`Perform.` tab under :menuselection:`Master Settings --> Core Settings`. Use the :guilabel:`List of newest Products (Just arrived!)` to select whether the products are assigned manually during the promotion or whether they are provided by the shop automatically. You can also switch off the promotion here completely so that the shop doesn’t spend any time to process it.

The additional setting :guilabel:`Show Prices in \"Top of the Shop\" and \"Just arrived!\"` in the :guilabel:`Perform.` tab affects the display of product prices for this and a further promotion.

Top seller
----------
If customers scroll down the start page, they will see the best-selling products in the shop. The display is similar to the two-column gallery of a product overview. From here, you can access the product’s details page or add the product directly to the shopping cart.

Products can be assigned to the \"Top seller\" promotion or determined by the shop. You can also deactivate the promotion here so that it won’t be processed or displayed on the start page.

The additional setting :guilabel:`Show Prices in \"Top of the Shop\" and \"Just arrived!\"` determines the display of product prices for this and a further promotion.
