Products tab
============

All products belonging to an order are listed in detail in the :guilabel:`Products` tab.

The quantity of the ordered products can be changed and updated at a later point. As a result, the product’s total price will be recalculated, and the shipping costs or the discount granted will also be updated.

Products included with an order can be cancelled or deleted completely by using the two icons at the end of each line. Clicking on the icon on the far right removes the respective products from the order. After you confirm your decision in a confirmation prompt, the line will be greyed out and the order total will be recalculated. Click on the icon one more time to undo the cancellation. The cancellation will be irrevocable if you have deleted the products from the order by clicking on the cross icon.

There is also a function that allows you to include new products in the order. Enter the product number to search for a specific product. Enter the quantity for the product found and click on :guilabel:`Add Product`. The product will be added to the order in the quantity entered.
